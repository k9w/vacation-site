## Description

_This is the third HTML & CSS page assigned for pair programming on Thursday January 6th 2022 at
[Epicodus](https://epicodus.com). We were given the option of working solo in the afternoon, which is when we got to this project. So we completed it indvidually. This page shows what I made later that weekend when I got to it._

_From [our curriculum](https://learnhowtoprogram.com), the assignment consisted of two parts:_
- [Practice: Installing and Implementing Bootstrap](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/practice-installing-and-implementing-bootstrap)
- [Practice: Grid System, Custom Styles, and More](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/practice-grid-system-custom-styles-and-more)
